step 1:
outer loop = no of rows
          == no of times outer loop will run

step 2:
with each row how many cols are present
== types of elenents in cols
//for every row run the col
**** ie develop a formula
then run the loop: (according to the question/pattern)
for(int col=1;col<=row;col++)

step 3:"what to print"
eg: */Alaphabets/nos

 we now need to add new line after creation of one row:
add cout<<"";
